# ReedsShepps
Using MATLAB and mex to calculate reeds shepp curves using C-code


## Getting Started

Install a MATLAB-supported compiler like MinGW

Use the MATLAB mex command, called a build script, to build a binary MEX file.

Use your binary MEX file like any MATLAB function.

### Prerequisites

Properly install compiler on MATLAB to mex the files


## Running the tests

running the TestCCode.m generates 2 random poses for a car and connects them with reeds shepps curves
